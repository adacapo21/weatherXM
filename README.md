## Description

**WeatherXM Services and API Endpoints**
Main Services included in this project:
- a service that retrieves a list of public devices (/devices) from the API and saves their basic info in a db.
- in regular intervals (e.g. every 1 minute), retrieve the current_weather for every device (/deviceById) of the list && update it in a different table/collection.

**API endpoints:**
- /devices : return the device list (full struct) from the db.
- /devices/:deviceId : Will return a single device from the db, including the basic device info and current weather.

**Tech Stack**: NestJS, MongoDB - Mongoose, Docker, Heroku

**Services main logic:** 
- **saveDevices**: Called on Application start once. Calling 2 main services:
  - **getWeatherDevicesFromEndpoint**: 
    - Call the endpoint of Devices provided and get the whole bunch of data from response
  - **devicesService** with its method insertBulk:
    - Insert all the data from response in bulk to DB
----

- Then and **every minute** is called the service **retrieveWeatherByDeviceId** with the main logic as described below:
  - GET all devices from DB by calling service devicesService by calling findAll method
  - Call endpoint for each device id from service **getDeviceByIdFromEndpoint**
    - If deviceID exist in DB then it updates current weather in DB in a new collection
